This sample script runs a model composed of a single, non-reactive
species.   After each run, the script prints the real time it took
to run the simulation in seconds.  This script may be useful for
a simple benchmarking purpose.

Look at the first part of the script run.py to check or modify
some parameters used in it.

T:  time when simulation is stopped.
V:  the volume of the space used in the simulation.
N:  the number of particles in the simulator volume.

Other parameters used are:
D:     Diffusion coefficient = 1e-12 [m^2/s]
sigma: Radius of particles = 3e-8 [m]

By default, the model has cyclic boundary in space.


After N particles are randomly placed, the simulator runs
for some small duration of time (stirTime in the script) to stir.
After that, the simulator is re-initialized, and run for T
to take the benchmark.
