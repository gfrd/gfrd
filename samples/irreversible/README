Introduction
=====================================

This sample script runs a system which initially has two particles
A and B, and samples the distance between the particles.  A and
B particles can react irreversibly.  

A + B -> C

When a reaction event occur, the script outputs zero as the value
of distance.



Running
======================================

The following command runs the simulation until a reaction occurs
or the simulator reaches time T, output the distance between
A and B to the file OUTFILE, and repeat this for N times.

PYTHONPATH=../../.. python run.py OUTFILE T N

For example:

PYTHONPATH=../../.. python run.py irr.out 0.0001 



Plotting
=======================================

The following plots the distribution of the distance r normalized
by the particle radius sigma, and compares with a theory plot.
Multiple set of input data can be given.

PYTHONPATH=../../.. python plot.py irr.out 0.0001 [INFILE T]...
