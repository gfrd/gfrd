Introduction
=====================================

This sample script runs a system which initially has two particles
A and B, and samples the distance between the particles.  There is
a reversible reaction defined in the model.

A + B <-> C

When a reaction event occur, the script outputs zero as the value
of distance.



Running
======================================

The following command runs the simulation until a reaction occurs
or the simulator reaches time T, output the distance between
A and B to the file OUTFILE, and repeat this for N times.

PYTHONPATH=../../.. python run.py OUTFILE T N

For example:

PYTHONPATH=../../.. python run.py rev.out 0.0001 



Plotting
=======================================

The following plots the distribution of the distance r normalized
by the particle radius sigma, and compares with a theory plot.
Multiple set of input data can be given.

PYTHONPATH=../../.. python plot.py rev.out p_rev.0.tsv 0.0001 [...]

Here, p_rev.0.tsv is the file that contains data generated by
the Mathematica script that can be found at doc/math/p_rev.nb.
The following samples files are provided:

p_rev.-2.tsv  -- corresponds to T = tau * 1e-2 = 1e-6
p_rev.-1.tsv  -- corresponds to T = tau * 1e-1 = 1e-5
p_rev.0.tsv   -- corresponds to T = tau * 1e-0 = 1e-4
p_rev.1.tsv   -- corresponds to T = tau * 1e-1 = 1e-3
p_rev.2.tsv   -- corresponds to T = tau * 1e-2 = 1e-2
p_rev.3.tsv   -- corresponds to T = tau * 1e-3 = 1e-1

where tau = sigma^2 / D is the timescale of the system.
