Visualization
=============

Notes
-----
* Right now this is not real-time. First you run your simulation, then you use 
  Paraview to visualize it.


Setting up the simulation
-------------------------
### Option 1
Let a vtklogger write visualization data for the last 100 steps.

* Setup the vtklogger like this in your simulation script (also see 
  <egfrdDir>/example/example.py):

	{% highlight python %}

        s.initialize()
        vtklogger = VTKLogger( s, 'myVisualizationDataDirectory', 100 )
        while(True):
            try:
                vtklogger.log()
                s.step()
            except RuntimeError, message:
                print 'Error.', message
                break
        vtklogger.stop()
        s.stop( s.t )

	{% endhighlight %}

* Replace 'myVisualizationDataDirectory' by a descriptive name for each 
  simulation that you run. It can be a nested directory structure, like 
  'data/10000steps/run1', and is automatically created.

* This stores all data in a buffer during the simulation, and only writes the 
  last 100 steps after the simulation has finished. 
  
### Option 2
Let a vtklogger write visualization data for all steps.

* This is done the same way as option 1, except remove the last argument to 
  VTKLogger.

* This writes the visualization data files directly during the simulation. See 
  below.




Running the simulation
----------------------
* Run the simulation script. 

  PYTHONPATH=../../ python run.py

* This should produce the files static.pvd and files.pvd inside the 
  visualization data directory specified in your simulation script. The former 
  contains static information about the surfaces you defined in your 
  simulation. The latter contains a list of references to .vtu files. For each 
  timestep there is a .vtu file that contains information about the particles, 
  a .vtu file for the sphericle shells, and a .vtu file for all the 
  cylindrical shells.  

* When not using a buffer, i.e. option 2, the .vtu files are created during 
  the simulation. However, we have to wait for the simulation to finish before 
  we can visualize the data using Paraview. It is not till the call to 
  vtklogger.stop() that files.pvd is created with an overview of all .vtu 
  files. This is the reason that the visualization can not be shown real-time 
  at the moment.




Configuring Paraview
--------------------
* Install Paraview. http://paraview.org/

* Copy the plugins <egfrdDir>/paraview/tensorGlyph.xml and
  <egfrdDir>/paraview/tensorGlyphCustomSource.xml to
  /home/<username>/.config/ParaView/ParaView<VERSION>/Plugins/
  replacing <VERSION> by the version of your Paraview installation (for
  example 3.6). These 2 files are needed to show cylinders of different sizes
  and different orientations correctly.

* In <egfrdDir>/paraview/pipeline.pvsm search for and replace
  /full/path/to/some/files.pvd and /full/path/to/some/static.pvd by the full
  paths to those files that were created by the simulation. So you should get 
  something like:
  /home/<username>/<egfrdDir>/simulations/<mySimulation>/<myVisualizationDataDirectory>/files.pvd
  and
  /home/<username>/<egfrdDir>/simulations/<mySimulation>/<myVisualizationDataDirectory>/static.pvd.

  Note that Paraview will crash if these files don't exist. And they have are
  to be absolute paths, using ~ for home directory, or ./../ for the egfrd
  directory doesn't seem to work. This means Paraview will also crash if you
  move your egfrd directory or something at some later point.

* Start Paraview.

* Go to Tools > Manage Plugins/Extensions and check that the plugins are
  loaded, or load them manually.

  Note that Paraview will crash if the plugins are not loaded when you try
  to load the pipeline in the next step.




Visualizing the data
--------------------
* Go to File > Load State, and select <egfrdDir>/paraview/pipeline.pvsm.

* Click the play button. You should see an animation of your simulation. Yeah!  




Tweaking the pipeline
---------------------
* From now on you can make changes to the pipeline from inside Paraview. Here
  is an example of what to do when you want to use data from a completely
  different simulation.
  - Right click in the Pipeline Browswer window. Open files.pvd in the 
    visualization data directory of the new simulation. Then click apply in 
    the Object Inspector window. The new files.pvd is now added to the 
    pipeline, but doesn't do anything yet.
  - Left click on the 'plus' next to files.pvd in the pipeline browser, then   
    right click on Objects below files.pvd, then Change Input. In the middle 
    window that appears, called Select Sources, select the new files.pvd file 
    you just added. It might be a bit hard to find. Click Ok. Objects is now 
    rewired to use the new files.pvd. 
  - Right click the old files.pvd, and delete it. Note that this is only 
    possible if you actually rewired Objects to a new files.pvd file in the 
    previous step, otherwise this options is grayed out.
  - If the definition of the surfaces also changed: open and apply the new
      static.pvd, rewire Surfaces to it and delete the old static.pvd.
  - Save the new pipeline. File > Save State.

* If you run a new simulation that writes to the same visualization data 
  directory, usually Paraview will reload the new data correctly. There can be 
  a problem if you increase the number of timesteps. If so, open the new 
  files.pvd into the pipeline and rewire Objects as explained above.

* Different species are given different colors. If you run a new simulation
  that has many more species, you might need to rescale the color range. Select
  Particle in the Pipeline Browser window. Then in the Object Inspector window
  click the middle tab called Display. Click Rescale to Data Range in the
  Color subsection.
  Typically you don't want to rescale the colors for Sphere and Cylinder.
  Pairs are given a different color (2) than Singles (1) by default. The
  sphere or cylinder that will be updated next is highlighed (color 0).
